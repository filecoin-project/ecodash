We are a site dedicated to helping people understand this brave new world: Whether it's trust-less networks, privacy coins or oracles, we strive to produce original coverage of the biggest stories, insightful profiles on the industryâ€™s movers and shakers as well as engaging educational content to connect the dots.\n\nDecrypt is funded by ConsenSys, a NY-based incubator, but we are both editorially independent and technologically agnostic. Our aim is to highlight to our readers what really matters, whilst providing a toolkit to understand the fundamentals. We are a map for the doers of Web3, to help navigate the space and uncover the expertise and resources they need to shape the industry for themselves."
