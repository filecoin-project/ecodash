The application will load all MOCA exhibitions, architecture, and artworks from a single point in time, attributed to artists, curators, collectors involved. Similar to the Wayback Machine, but here focused on documenting the creative renaissance of cryptocurrency and the artists and collectors exploring artistry in NFTs.",
